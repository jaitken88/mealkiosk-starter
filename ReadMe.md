## Trying it out

To make sure this works on your machine, clone this repository and run the Gradle build command, e.g.:

```
> gradlew build
```

Should result in a bunch of files downloading, compiling the code, and then running the tests, which should pass.
If all goes well, you should see:

```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
