# Meal Kiosk

Starter project for Java class.

## Trying it out

To make sure this works on your machine, clone this repository and run the Maven validate command, e.g.:

```
> mvn test
```

Should result in a bunch of files downloading, compiling the code, and then running the tests, which should pass.
You will see something like this:

```
